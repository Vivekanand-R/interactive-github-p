- **Empty Repositories**: Thoughtful empty states encouraging repository creation with helpful guidance
- **Large Repository Sets**: Virtual scrolling and progressive loading for users with hundreds of repositories
- **Mobile Interactions**: Touch-optimized card interactions with swipe gestures and responsive layouts
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high contrast mode options

## Design Direction

The design should feel like a premium developer portfolio - sophisticated and cutting-edge with subtle technological elegance that demonstrates attention to detail and modern design sensibilities, balancing rich interactive features with clean minimalism that lets the work speak for itself.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using a sophisticated blue-orange contrast to create visual hierarchy and energy while maintaining professional credibility.

- **Primary Color**: Deep technological blue `oklch(0.45 0.15 240)` - Communicates trust, professionalism, and technical expertise
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays `oklch(0.25 0.02 240)` and `oklch(0.95 0.02 240)` for backgrounds and supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Warm orange `oklch(0.70 0.15 45)` - Highlights interactive elements, CTAs, and achievements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White `oklch(1 0 0)`): Dark gray text `oklch(0.25 0.02 240)` - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Light gray `oklch(0.98 0.01 240)`): Dark text `oklch(0.25 0.02 240)` - Ratio 7.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep blue `oklch(0.45 0.15 240)`): White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 6.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm orange `oklch(0.70 0.15 45)`): White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey technical precision and modern sophistication - using Inter for its excellent readability and professional character, with code elements in JetBrains Mono for technical authenticity.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Portfolio Title): Inter Bold/36px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Descriptions): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height (1.6)
  - Code (Technical details): JetBrains Mono Regular/14px/monospace spacing
  - Caption (Metadata): Inter Regular/14px/subtle color

## Animations

Animations should feel purposeful and sophisticated - subtle enough for professional environments while adding moments of delight that demonstrate technical craftsmanship and attention to detail.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates technical excellence through precise timing and demonstrates interactivity through responsive feedback
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Card interactions receive primary animation focus, with subtle hover states and smooth transitions supporting the exploration experience
